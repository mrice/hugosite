Happy Tuesday, blockchain engineers (and counsel)!

In today’s update we notice the Solidity open source dev community is busy, I invite you to join me at the first LA Smart Contract Meetup, and Jimmy Wales says blockchain can’t be banned. **But he’s wrong.**

## Some Solidity updates for your Tuesday

There's an updated or [refreshed guide on Truffle migrations](https://www.sitepoint.com/truffle-migrations-explained/) on Sitepoint, which is kind of helpful. Speaking candidly, my ```truffle migrate``` command has been failing me of late. Maybe this guide, which I think I've worked with before, will help me out. And you too.

The Solidity developers are hard at work - 25 commits today alone.

There's [some extended discussion](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4262) about how to target EVM versions in syntax tests, which I wonder is becoming more important with the new changes being planned (e.g., Casper). Of note, one of the commenters reminds that you can target a version with ```soltest --evm-version```.

Also, a plug for my upcoming the first [LA Smart Contract Meetup conference call](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Smart-Contract-Meetup/events/251541758/). Free for anyone to join. If you want the bridge number but don't want to register for Meetup drop me a note (email coming up below).

**Hey let me know** if you're out there and struggling with Truffle migrate too or looking forward to 0.5.0 (or not) or wanna listen in on my lunch update call:  [michael@michaelricelaw.com](mailto:michael@michaelricelaw.com).

## Surfing the web (web1, not web2, and certainly not web3)

[Apla](https://apla.io) issued a press release on something kind of baffling to me. They're promoting [something they call "smart laws,"](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/apla-offers-smart-laws-as-a-solution-for-transaction-fidelity-in-blockchains-300664739.html) which seem to be different from smart contracts in that they're mutable in some way -- able to respond to technical or even policy flaws in the original deployments. **Kind of interesting but seems to open a can of worms to me**. If you know more about what they're doing or planning, please let me know.

An article on CCN cites a study by a YouTube guy (see how I'm qualifying its veracity there) [saying](https://www.ccn.com/94-out-of-top-100-blockchain-projects-are-built-on-ethereum/) that "the Ethereum community already has more than 250,000 developers and **94 out of the top 100 blockchain projects** have launched on top of the Ethereum network." Whatever the true numbers are, I thought that was an interesting statistic to share with your friends.

## Legal Updates

In the **Ripple litigation**, Mary Jo White, the former (tough!) SEC commissioner, was officially admitted *pro hac* and the plaintiff agreed to give Ripple until June 22 to file an answer; however, they'll probably extend that further. The plaintiff is planning to file a motion to send back to state court, as I expected.

Malta's making a name for itself in the ICO space and [this Mondaq article](http://www.mondaq.com/x/709388/fin+tech/Snapshot+Summary+Of+Three+Bills+Related+to+Blockchain+Technology) has a decent, if brief, analysis of some of the pending legislation over there across the pond.

Jimmy Wales [said recently](https://ethereumworldnews.com/jimmy-wales-cant-ban-blockchain/), "you **can't ban blockchain** because it's math" (I'm paraphrasing). That's absurd. Of course a government can. Don’t take word for it, read Prof. Wright’s *Blockchain and the Law*.

While governments *should* regulate  is a whole 'nother question and the article a short read with some interesting points from Wales.

That’s all I’ve got for you today. See you tomorrow.
