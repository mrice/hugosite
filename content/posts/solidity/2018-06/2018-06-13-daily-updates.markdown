We're keeping it short but keeping it real in today's update. A

## Solidity Community Updates

Short and somewhat cursory write up on a lottery smart contract, but it uses an oracle for random numbers which might be interesting to some of you all http://jacksonng.org/Lottery-Contract-2

Not really Solidity related, but closely related to the ecosystem, I noticed that the last commit in [the web3 develop repo](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/commits/develop) was May 17 and, it seems like there's only been light activity in 2018. That could be a good or bad thing. On the one hand, it may mean that there isn't a lot of innovation going on in the space. On the other hand, it might mean the library is stable and mature (along with the underlying blockchain) enough to not need much change recently. My instinct is that it's the latter not the former!

## Legal Updates

Don't miss Aaron Wright's *Blockchain and the Law* [panel](https://cardozo.yu.edu/events/blockchain-and-law-path-forward-responsible-blockchain-sector) with some great panelists tomorrow at 4:00 Eastern. Live stream available. Hopefully a recording too.

[Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-do-we-know-about-valerie-szczepanik-the-first-crypto-czar) has a thoughtful write up trying to read the tea leaves on **where Valerie Szczepanik will try to steer the SEC in her new role as "crypto czar."**
