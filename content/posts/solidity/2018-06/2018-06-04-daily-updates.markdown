Happy Monday Developers,

What do you have going on this week anyway? What are you excited about? Let me know -- [michael@michaelricelaw.com](mailto:michael@michaelricelaw.com)!

## Solidity Random Community Updates

Not ready to vouch for it, but the [IBM Blockchain Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-blockchain-essentials-for-developers/home/welcome) course **started today on Coursera**. There's still time to register I think. I just did, so I'll try to give you some updates as I go through it. Saw it on the ethereum/tutorials on Gitter, btw.

Having **trouble with this**? Does it say it says that it's unavailable?

```javascript
var account = web3.eth.accounts.create()
```
Try this from yan300: "Your node needs to have "personal" endpoint opened. In geth you can use the --rpcapi 'eth,personal'"

Raine says, "Hello! Would anybody be interested in contributing to [solgraph](https://github.com/raineorshine/solgraph)? I created this project 2 years ago as an experiment. Since then it has accumulated 400 stars and continues to receive interest. I havenâ€™t worked on the project since its creation. There are some **open issues and its solidity version needs to be upgraded to support the latest language features**." Looks like an interesting project.

Also heard on Gitter: the **chain-in conference extended it's call for papers/presentations to June 10**. [Submit your talk here.](http://chain-in.org/speaker.php) Thinking about it myself but I think my passport expired, so even if I did get accepted.....!

Current standard cost for a transfer on ETH is $0.073 as I write this. [https://ethgasstation.info](https://ethgasstation.info)

Phew... I'm tired. That's it for tonight.
